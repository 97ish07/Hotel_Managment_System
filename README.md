# About the Project
We were developed an administrator-based web application for the hotel "Diyatha", a fictitious hotel. 
There, we are mainly focusing on the most common problems that can be seen in a hotel management 
system, such as

• Physical space consuming

• Much time consuming

• Difficulty to find records

• Difficult to analyzed records

• Require lot of labor effort 

• Lack of security 

• Lack of permanence of records 

The hotel management system that we implemented will provide solutions to all the 
problems that are mentioned above. And it will be with extra functions that would not be possible with 
manual procedures. All the hotel information will be stored in a database, including room information, 
inventory, restaurant information, and room bookings. This enables fast and easy retrieval of records, 
which will take only seconds. By using this system, data entry will be more reliable and accurate, and 
report generation will be so easy that the manager does not even worry about them. The system will 
generate reports automatically and display them in a user-friendly manner. By using this system, data 
redundancy will be completely avoided. Another major advantage of using this system is data privacy 
and security. Data can be accessed by only authorized people, and only managers can take database 
backups, restore, or remove it. The newly introduced web application system, Hotel Management 
System for Hotel "Diyatha", will automate the major operations of the hotel. This system will be able 
to handle many services and take care of the admins in a quick manner. As a solution to the large 
amount of file handling happening at the hotel, this system will be used to overcome those drawbacks. 
The managers can access the system functionalities with limited restrictions. The responsible managers 
are: room manager, inventory manager, room booking manager, and restaurant manager. The main 
functions of the system are:

• Manage all room types and room services

• Manage the hotel's inventory.

• Manage food orders and menu information.

• Manage Room Reservation

This system will be user-appropriate, easy to use, and provide easy recovery and end-user high 
satisfaction.
